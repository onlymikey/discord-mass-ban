## 🛠️ Installation
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) must be installed on your computer; please get the most recent version. Before running the scripts, ensure that you have all of the required feilds in `config.json` filled in.

### Windows 🪟
If you're running Windows, you can [download](https://codeload.github.com/qro/mass-ban/zip/refs/heads/master) the .zip file directly from GitHub. In this case, you can still use [Git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases) to clone my repository. 

Extract the Zip file and then open your command prompt in the same directory
```
$ py user.py
```
Or
```
$ py bot.py
```

### Linux 🐧
If you're running Linux, clone my repository into your own directory by using this command
```
$ sudo apt install git
$ git clone https://github.com/qro/mass-ban.git
$ cd mass-ban
```
From there,
```
$ python3 user.py
